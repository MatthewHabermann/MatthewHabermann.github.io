<p>I am a mathematician, primarily interested in 
symplectic topology and its interactions with algebraic geometry, 
representation theory and low-dimensional topology. 

</p> I am currently a Senior Research Associate and EPSRC Fellow at Lancaster University, a position I have held since February 2025. Until October 2024, I was a postdoc at the Quantum Universe Cluster of Excellence at the University of Hamburg. Before this, I was a PhD student in London at the <a 
href="https://www.lsgnt-cdt.ac.uk/">London school of geometry and number theory (LSGNT)</a>, where my advisor was <a href="https://lekili.duckdns.org/">Yankı Lekili</a>.

</p> A complete CV (where you can also find my email address) is available <a href="HabermannCV.pdf">here</a>, and my Google Scholar profile <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=yueZ2J8AAAAJ"> here. </a>
